# Probability of Default (PD) Modelling – CRIS

This document outlines the high-level approach used in CRIS
to develop a baseline Probability of Default (PD) model.

## Overview
- Behavioural features engineered from transactional data
- Logistic regression used for explainable risk modelling
- Model validated using ROC-AUC and KS statistics

## Purpose
The PD model serves as a proof-of-concept credit risk engine,
aligned with industry-standard banking practices.
